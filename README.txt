This directory contains the readings, materials, and examples for the workshop offered at the Exploring Human Host-Microbiome Interactions in Health and Disease 2016 conference.

The primary focus will be on explaining why microbiome data are compositional, limits and caveats on the analysis of compositional data, and finally proper methods to analyze such data. Practical methods to deal with the sparse nature of the data will be presented and demonstrated in practice.

The workshop will focus on hands-on application of three main methods.

Exploratory data analysis using the compositional biplot which shows the variance in both the samples and the taxa on one plot.

Proper correlation and association analysis using the latest methods including the phi-metric and the SPIEC-EASI tool.

Examination of differential abundance under a compositional approach using the ALDEx2 tool.

Workshop participants should read the following:

multi_comp.pdf, and coda_seq.pdf: brief introductions to the problem from different perspectives
first_biplot.pdf: exploratory data analysis using compositional biplots
make_interpret_biplot: a simple biplot with random data
first_comparison.pdf: finding maximally different taxa using ALDEx2
first_association.pdf: finding maximally associated taxa using phi
