Title:

	Welcome to the Simplex: analyzing your microbiome datasets as compositions

Instructors:

	Gregory Gloor, Professor of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario
	Jean Macklaim, Post Doctoral Researcher, University of Western Ontario

Summary:

Microbiome datasets in one lab are often irreproducible in another. For example, examination of 6 papers examining the role of the microbiome in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease reveals no overlap in the taxa identified as distinguishing this disease from health. In part, this irreproducibility is a consequence of the use of inappropriate analysis methods.

Data generated by high throughput sequencing has a constraint on the number of counts imposed by the machine - for example, the same library will give different numbers of reads when sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq instrument. Thus, the number of reads observed for a given sample gives no information on the number of molecules in the underlying sample. Such data are called compositional data, and must be treated as such for analysis. Compositional data behave very differently than normal count data: operations such as addition and subtraction are not valid (meaning common statistical tests are misleading), and  covariance and correlation have unpredictable outcomes (meaning clustering, ordination and network analysis give spurious and unreliable outputs).

Compositional data can be analyzed properly by examining only the ratios between OTUs or genes, since this information is conserved no matter the sequencing depth. People enrolled in this short course will be introduced to the compositional data analysis toolkit, and how to adapt it to sparse microbiome, transcriptome or metagenome datasets. Students will learn how to use and interpret compositional biplots for exploratory analysis of their datasets. Students will learn to apply compositionally appropriate methods for outlier detection and pairwise difference analysis. Finally, students will be shown how to use and interpret compositional association as a replacement for correlation.

Students should bring their own laptop with an up-to-date version of the R statistical programming language installed. Students are encouraged to bring their own datasets for analysis. A list of readings and R packages required for the course will be available upon registration.
